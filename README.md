This is a repository for dynamically generating energy models within Python, relying on Archetypal and Eppy for most of its functionality.

- **Github repository**: <https://github.com/szvsw/epinterface/>

## Configuration

The EnergyPlus version used when creating IDF objects can be configured via the `EPINTERFACE_ENERGYPLUS_VERSION` environment variable. It defaults to `22.2.0`. Both dotted (`22.2.0`) and hyphenated (`22-2-0`) version formats are accepted.

- **Documentation** <https://szvsw.github.io/epinterface/>

## Getting started with your project

First, create a repository on GitHub with the same name as this project, and then run the following commands:

```bash
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "init commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:szvsw/epinterface.git
git push -u origin main
```

Finally, install the environment and the pre-commit hooks with

```bash
make install
```

You are now ready to start development on your project!
The CI/CD pipeline will be triggered when you open a pull request, merge to main, or when you create a new release.
