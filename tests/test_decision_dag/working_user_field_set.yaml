context_description: We are building energy models for a portfolio of ~5,000 residential
  buildings in Massachusetts for a utility-funded energy efficiency program. The goal
  is to estimate building energy use and identify retrofit opportunities. Data is
  sparse and of mixed quality.

region_description: Massachusetts, USA. IECC Climate Zone 5A. Cold winters, warm humid
  summers. Heating-dominated climate with ~5,500 HDD65 and ~700 CDD65. State energy
  code is based on IECC 2021 for new construction.

building_stock_description: Predominantly older housing stock. Roughly 60% of buildings
  were built before 1960. Mix of wood-frame (most common for single-family), triple-decker
  multi-family (very common in urban MA), and some masonry construction in older urban
  cores. Natural gas heating dominates (~65%), followed by oil (~20%), and electric/heat
  pump (~15%). Many older buildings have minimal insulation, especially in walls.

supplementary_context:
- title: Typical Wall Construction by Era
  content: 'Pre-1940: Double-wythe brick or balloon-frame wood with no insulation,
    plaster interior. Infiltration is very high (often 1.0+ ACH).

    1940-1970: Platform-frame wood, often with minimal batt insulation (R-7 to R-11
    cavities), some with aluminum siding over original clapboard. Infiltration moderate
    (0.5-0.8 ACH).

    1970-2000: Wood frame with R-11 to R-19 cavity insulation, vinyl or wood siding,
    some continuous insulation in later builds. Infiltration moderate (0.3-0.6 ACH).

    Post-2000: Wood frame with R-19+ cavity, often R-5 to R-10 continuous exterior
    insulation, air sealing. Infiltration low (0.15-0.35 ACH).'

- title: Thermostat Schedules
  content: 'When a building has a smart thermostat, use the setback parameters to implement heating and cooling setpoint setbacks in order to save energy, similar to how a NEST thermostat might do so.  If a building does not have a smart thermostat, use a constant setpoint year round for both heating and cooling.'

- title: Massachusetts Weatherization Program Notes
  content: 'The MA WAP program typically performs: air sealing (blower-door guided),
    attic insulation to R-38 minimum, wall insulation (dense-pack cellulose) where
    feasible, and sometimes basement/crawlspace insulation. Weatherized homes see
    roughly a 20-30% reduction in infiltration and improved wall/attic R-values compared
    to un-weatherized homes of the same era.'
